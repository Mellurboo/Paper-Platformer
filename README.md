# Paper 2D Platformer

![Image in Unreal Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mellurboo/Paper-Platformer/refs/heads/main/.github/hero.png)

I made this game for school again, it was actually the first project we started and I'm still improving it

This is actually my favourite because I've learnt the most doing it.

### Finished Evaluation

theres a lot of issues and things I would have done differently but I have learnt a lot about Unreal Engine 5 during this project. 

I am excited to move on to the next project I do in unreal engine.

**for this project no grade is provided**
